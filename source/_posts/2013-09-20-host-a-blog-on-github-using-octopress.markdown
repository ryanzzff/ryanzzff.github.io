<!--What?
Koding:
Github Pages: A Free Hosting that allow us to publish contents like this blog.
Octopress: A framework that designed for Jekyll

Markdown: A markup language that intended to be easy-to-read and easy-to-write, then it will be converted to HTML.
-->
Why?
I'm new to Koding, new to Octopress, new to Github, and I am a programmer. I just want to have a platform to store something useful for myself (...if not useful to others), mostly programming, so posting code snippet conveniently is my second priority (of course the most important thing is free!). 

How?
Prerequisite:
To use Octopress, you don't necessarily need to have a Koding account, any OS that can run ruby 1.9.3 and git would be ok. If you really want a Koding account, Sign up here and I will have an extra 250 mb of free space on my VM ;)
